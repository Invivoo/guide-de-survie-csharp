This is the draft of the Kata project designed to help developers to sharpen their coding skills. As mentioned by Dave Thomas on his website http://codekata.com/ in order to be good at something you need to repetitavely do the exercises with small improvements over time.
Originally, when I came across the concept, I thought it will help me understand new coding principles. Later on, I was faced with the requirement to show my coding skills during the interview by doing Kata exercise.
Takeaway from that experience was that it provided the interviewer with the direct knowledge of the skills the candidate has and asess the proper fit with the team coding principles, without the need of long list of questions.
For example, did the candidate started coding unit tests - demonstrating the knowledge of TDD; was he open to seting up his work environment with the tools and extensions to help with the exercise - showing an ability to be flexible or rigid with the available tools.
Aim of this project is to create some Katas to aid in preparing future candidates in being able to demonstrate themselves in the best light possible, while improving their understanding of core coding principles.
